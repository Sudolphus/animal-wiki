          <li>They have scales that makes them look like they should be slimy, but they're actually very smooth!</li>
          <li>Snakes have multiple sets of eyelids, and some are transparent, so they can protect their eyes while still being able to see</li>
          <li>Many of them can swim!</li>

          <li>I apologize if you have more than 8 legs. I shouldn't make assumptions.</li>
          <li>Spiders are fuzzy sometimes.</li>
          <li>Some spiders are very toxic! Others build traps and lairs! Some chase their prey down!</li>
